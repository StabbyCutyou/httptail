# HttpTail

Ever wanted to see all the little redirects that happen when you call a url?

Now you can tail them, kinda!

## Usage
```
cd cmd/httptail
go build
./httptail https://the.url.you.want.to.tail.com.edu.co.uk
```

Please Enjoy

# License
You're not allowed to use this repo or this code to do anything evil or to be a huge jerk, it's strictly forbidden by the license. By reading this statement, even silently to yourself, you are now bound by it. I decide what evil / being a jerk means, you do not get to decide that. You are also bound by *that*, because you kept reading, but even if you didn't, you'd still be bound by it, because you agreed to the whole license already by even beginning to read it. Seems unfair, but thats life.

Otherwise go nuts.
